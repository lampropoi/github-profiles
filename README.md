This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

It is a web app build in which the front-end is built with React.js and the back-end with Node.js.

To run the app, do the following:

1. Clone the repo
2. Run `npm install`
3. To run the front-end, run: `npm start`
4. To run the back-end, run: `npm run server`
5. Access localhost/3000 to enjoy the app!
