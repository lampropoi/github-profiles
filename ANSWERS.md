## How long did you spend on the coding test?
It was a nice app, that took me approximately 6hours_

## What would you add to your solution if you had more time?
1. I would add tests
1. Loading module while waiting the front-end to get response from back-end
1. Deploy the app in Heroku_

}

## How would you improve the application's performance?
I would not use a back end to get Github repos. I would use the front-end instead to fetch the results. Also, Github has GraphQL API, which means that I could get only the fields that I use in the app and eliminate the big amount of data that are currently processed by the front-end. Last, I would cache some results for next searches.
